<!-- I was a Postdoctoral researcher at MBZUAI working with Dr. [Shangsong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4uggVcIAAAAJ). 
Our team, led by Dr Liang works closely with Prof. [Eilam Gross](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iibZFkYAAAAJ) from Weizmann Institute of Science on  **Particle Physics** projects, where we aim to apply deep neural networks to predict new particles. -->

I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Natural and Computing Science, University of Aberdeen, UK. Before this position, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at MBZUAI. Currently, I work on the following topics with my collaborators all over the world:
1. LLM Multi-agent Collaboration
2. GNN for biomedical network interaction (e.g., DNA, RNA, Protein, Diseases, Bacteria)
3. Multi-modal Single-cell Analysis
4. Biomedical Image Analysis 


<!--working with Dr. [Shangsong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4uggVcIAAAAJ). In addition, I work with Dr. [Zaiqiao Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5jJKFVcAAAAJ&hl=en) and we lead the **BioKR2** (Bio Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) Lab. The ultimate goal of **BioKR2** is to inspire bioinformatics research by using meaningful representation learning methods.-->

I used to be a PhD student of [Terrier team](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/index.html), supervised by Prof. [Iadh Ounis](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/) and Prof. [Craig Macdonald](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/craigmacdonald/#).

I am one of the co-founders and main contributors of the [Beta-Recsys](https://beta-recsys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project, an open-source project for Building, Evaluating and Tuning Automated Recommender Systems.

<!-- Graduate studentship, RA, Postdoc positions avaiable at MBZUAI. Highly self-motivated students are always wanted if you want to do research on **Graph Neural Networks**, **Large Language Models** and **AI4Science**. Drop me an email: siwei[dot]liu[at]abdn[dot]ac[dot]uk. -->
